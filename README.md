  ABSTRACT

Indian classical dance has been part of Indian Culture from around 200 BC. These classical dance forms are named *‘Natya Rasa’* in the Sanskrit text *‘Natya Shastra’*. According to *Natya Shastra* there exists *108 karanas* (action of hands, feet and body). *Mudras*  are used as a support for visual communication. This work inquires into the possibility of identifying mudras in various classical dance forms of India. Not everyone are expertise in understanding the core idea represented in the classical dance forms and know what each pose portrays. The work attempts to find the feasibility of identifying the mudras depicted in a classical dance form video and define its meaning. The core theme of the classical dance forms is rightfully conveyed to the viewer. The classical art forms could thus find a place in the minds of people. The viewer can appreciate the artist and glorify the art form. The heritage of India can be protected. 

Since the work seeks to identify and provide brief description on the hasta mudras of dance forms, the machine learning concepts are explored to frame the best solution. The first task is to capture the data images. As the area of consideration is video, there comes the need to extract images frame by frame from the video. The need for populating a dataset with the images of hasta mudras is essential to create an accurate model for classification. The Convolutional neural network (CNN) strategy is used for the implementation. The classical dance forms play a vital role in enriching the heritage of India. An attempt is made to explore the possibility of identifying the mudras in these dance forms. The work makes an effort to help the viewer identify the exact mudras depicted in a dance form and gives a brief description of them. The viewer who aspires to enjoy the classical dance form to its fullest is benefited. The Indian classical dance forms get proper recognition when more people get to appreciate the art forms.
